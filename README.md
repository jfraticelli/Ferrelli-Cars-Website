Ferrelli Cars is an enthusiast car rental web application project. It is built with the Python-based, Flask framework and uses Bootstrap libraries, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is embedded with a SQLite database to store user and rental information.

The flaskferrelli folder includes all source code to run the website including python, css, and html files. It also includes the SQLite database for storing user and rental information.

The screenshots folder contains screenshots of the Ferrelli Cars website running on local host and displays all webpages. 

Notes: the home page has a revolving slide show of featured stock. The collection page has a feature that drops down a semi-transparent cover when hovering over a car that displays it's year, make, and model. The user can click on the image of the car they wish to rent within the collections page that takes them directly to the checkout page.
